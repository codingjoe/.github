## Disclosure

Since open-source software is maintained by a community of volunteers, please allow up to 90 days for a response before making any public disclosure. After 90 days, if no response has been received, you may disclose the vulnerability publicly.

## Safe Harbor Commitment

The maintainers and contributors will not pursue legal action against researchers who act in good faith and comply with this Policy. Unauthorized access to personal data, intellectual property theft, or malicious exploitation is strictly prohibited.

## Bug Bounty & Attribution

At this time, we do not offer a bug bounty program. However, we appreciate and recognize the efforts of security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us.

If you would like to be acknowledged for your contribution, please let us know when you report the vulnerability. We will include your name in our list of security researchers who have helped improve the security of our project, unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Security Updates

We are committed to promptly addressing security vulnerabilities. Once a vulnerability is reported and verified, we will work to release a fix as quickly as possible. Security updates will be communicated through our usual channels, including release notes and announcements on our project page.

## Supported Versions

We actively maintain and provide security updates for the latest major version of our software. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest version to benefit from the most recent security fixes and improvements.
